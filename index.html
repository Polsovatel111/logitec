          Logitech from the inside: how to create and test gaming mice By Henri
          Sergeev, December 19, 2014, 00:00 Logitech does not just test mice and
          keyboards, they are simply "tortured" here. The keys are pressed 13
          times a second, 24 hours a day, for two months. When Logitech
          engineers developed the G402 Hyperion Fury gaming mouse, which
          accurately tracks the cursor movement at a speed of more than 450
          inches/sec, a mechanical arm with a built-in spring was designed,
          which was supposed to test the mouse in the harshest conditions until
          the latter failed.
